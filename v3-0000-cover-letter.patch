Subject: [RFC PATCH v3 0/8] xfstests: add fs-verity tests

Add tests for fs-verity, a new feature for read-only file-based
authenticity protection.  fs-verity will be supported by ext4 and f2fs,
and perhaps by other filesystems later.  Running these tests requires:

- A kernel with the fs-verity patches applied and configured with
  CONFIG_FS_VERITY.  Specifically, this version of the xfstests patchset
  is compatible with version 6 of the kernel patchset, which can be
  retrieved from tag "fsverity_2019-07-01" of
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/linux.git

- The fsverity utility program from
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/fsverity-utils.git
  It needs to be commit 2151209ce1da or later.

- e2fsprogs v1.45.2 or later for ext4 tests, or f2fs-tools v1.11.0 or
  later for f2fs tests.

Example with kvm-xfstests:

	$ kvm-xfstests -c ext4,f2fs -g verity

For more information about fs-verity, see the file
Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst from the kernel patchset.

This version of the xfstests patchset can also be retrieved from tag
"fsverity_2019-07-01" of
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/xfstests-dev.git

Changed since v2 (Jun. 2019):

  - Updated the signature verification test (generic/905) to match the
    latest kernel and fsverity-utils changes.

  - Added _fsv_sign() utility function.

  - Correctly skip the fs-verity tests on ext3-style filesystems.

Changed since v1 (Dec. 2018):

  - Updated all tests to use the new fs-verity kernel API.

  - Many cleanups, additional checks in the tests, and other improvements.

  - Addressed review comments from Eryu Guan.

  - Added a test for the built-in signature verification feature.

  - Removed the fs-verity descriptor validation test, since the on-disk
    format of this part was greatly simplified and made fs-specific.

Eric Biggers (8):
  common/filter: add _filter_xfs_io_fiemap()
  common/verity: add common functions for testing fs-verity
  generic: test general behavior of verity files
  generic: test access controls on the fs-verity ioctls
  generic: test corrupting verity files
  generic: test that fs-verity is using the correct measurement values
  generic: test using fs-verity and fscrypt simultaneously
  generic: test the fs-verity built-in signature verification support
